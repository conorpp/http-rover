    h1(class='color0') The UAV Project
    .textWrap
        p
            | The plan is to make a UAV that anyone can control freely
            | from the internet.  A UAV is a unmanned automated vehicle.
            | What makes the rover automated is the supply of people willing
            | to drive it around.
        p
            | This UAV would allow anyone to complete simple tasks remotely,
            | like going on patrols, picking up coffee, or talking.
        p
            | The rover supports all range of motion, live video, and
            | two way audio streaming.  The rover has a GPS and restricts
            | it's driving range around a few geological points so that
            | it can't be driven around unsafe areas like roads and cliffs.
        p
            | We eventually want to try the same project with a quadcopter or
            | some other aerial vehicle.
